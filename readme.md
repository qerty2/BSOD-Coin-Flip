**THIS ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS!!**

**This script WILL crash your computer if you lose the game. It will NOT do any damage to your computer.**

Simple python program that asks the user to guess heads or tails, and if you guess wrong it crashes (blue screens) your computer.

Uses a very well documented function built into windows to trigger a blue screen, so this wont cause any damage.

Doesnt contain any big flashy "THIS WILL BLUE SCREEN YOUR COMPUTER!" warning in the script so you can use it to mess with your friends

If you download the .exe version from the releases tab, it may be marked as malicious by your antivirus. This is a well known problem with pyinstaller, which was used to compile it from a .py to a .exe that anyone can run. You can read more about it [here.](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/6754)

TLDR: If the script is marked as malicious; its not. The source code is available for you to read [here](https://github.com/qerty2/BSOD-Coin-Flip/blob/main/main.py) and if you dont trust the .exe you can always compile it yourself.
