**This script WILL crash your computer if you lose the game. It will NOT do any damage to your computer.**

Honestly im not evens sure why im putting this on github but:

Simple command line program that asks you "Heads or Tails" and if you choose wrong blue screens your computer.

It uses very well documented functions built into windows to blue screen your computer safely. I havent put in any warning saying "This will blue screen your computer!" or anything in the script so you can mess with your friends, but dont be a dick.

Its an insanely small script but constructive criticism would be great if you have any, as im decently new to python and programming in general (code isnt shit dont worry)
